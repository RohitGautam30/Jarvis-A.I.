Several options, depending on the style of "Sunflower" you want:

**Option 1:  Upbeat and Pop-like (similar to the Post Malone/Swae Lee song)**

(Verse 1)
Sunrise paints the sky in gold, another day unfolds
Feel the warmth upon my face, in this quiet, peaceful place
Got that sunshine in my soul, feeling totally in control
With you beside me, everything's alright

(Chorus)
Sunflower, tall and bright, reaching for the fading light
You're my sunshine, my delight, burning ever so bright
We'll chase the shadows far away, and greet a brand new day
Sunflower, come what may, you light up my way

(Verse 2)
We'll walk hand-in-hand, across the golden sand
Laughing freely, side by side, with nowhere left to hide
The world outside can fade to grey, but our love will light the way
A perfect moment, here to stay

(Chorus)
Sunflower, tall and bright, reaching for the fading light
You're my sunshine, my delight, burning ever so bright
We'll chase the shadows far away, and greet a brand new day
Sunflower, come what may, you light up my way


**Option 2:  More Folk/Acoustic Style**

(Verse 1)
A single stalk, against the blue, a vibrant yellow hue
Reaching upward, strong and true, kissed by morning dew
A symbol of hope, a silent plea, for all the world to see
The beauty found in purity

(Chorus)
Oh, sunflower, turning slow, watching the seasons grow
Your golden face, a gentle glow, a love I'm meant to know
Through summer's heat and autumn's chill, your spirit strong and still
A simple flower, on the hill

(Verse 2)
The wind may blow, the rain may fall, but you stand proud and tall
A testament to one and all, that beauty conquers all
A humble grace, a quiet might, a beacon burning bright
A simple flower, bathed in light


**Option 3:  A more melancholic/reflective style:**

(Verse 1)
Faded gold, a drooping head, the summer's warmth has fled
A lonely stalk, where dreams lay dead, a silent tear is shed
The vibrant hues, now pale and weak, a promise left to speak
Of fleeting joys, beyond our reach

(Chorus)
Sunflower, your beauty's gone, the vibrant summer's dawn
Has faded out, the light withdrawn, a lonely vigil drawn
But even in your fading grace, a memory I embrace
A silent beauty, time can't erase

(Verse 2)
Though petals fall, and stems grow frail, your essence will prevail
A whispered story, a gentle tale, a love that will not fail
In every seed, a hope remains, to bloom again through sun and rains


Remember to choose the option that best suits your desired sound and feeling.  I can also adapt these further if you provide more detail on what kind of "Sunflower" you envision.
